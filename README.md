# Technical Test D-ICE

Please clone this repository, open "sensor.pro" with QT and build Debug or Release to test the application.

Also, you will find this binary file "./bin/sensor-win-exe.zip", to unzip everywhere and run "sensor.exe" to test the application on Windows platform. Normally this file doesn't be there, it's CI/DI to deploy somewhere.

Note : At each executable running, we fill a random list between 5 and 10 sensors and the refresh is every 1 seconde with random change on state et signal's strength
